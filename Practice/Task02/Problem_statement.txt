Task-02: AWS S3 Bucket and IAM User Creation Using Terraform

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Use Terraform to create an S3 bucket in AWS.
   - Enable versioning for the S3 bucket.
   - Add tags to the S3 bucket for identification and organization (e.g., Name, Environment).

2. **Create an IAM User and Policy**:
   - Use Terraform to create an IAM user.
   - Create an IAM policy that grants the IAM user the necessary permissions to access and manage the S3 bucket. This could include permissions like `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, etc.
   - Attach the created IAM policy to the IAM user.

3. **Attach IAM User to the S3 Bucket**:
   - Attach the IAM user to the S3 bucket by assigning the created policy to the user, allowing them to interact with the bucket based on the defined permissions.
